You are the assistant of an elephant, that owns a china shop. Unfortunately your elephantous employer had a boozy evening with his friends again and now he is rampaging in his own china shop. Like every time it's up to you to use your Reparinator 2000 to repair all the broken porcelain before the shop opens in the morning. How to play: Shoot at broken china with your gun to set the broken pieces together and put it back in a shelf.
